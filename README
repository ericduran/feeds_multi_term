This is a very Basic Multi Term Imported for Feeds.

In order to import multiple taxonomy terms you will need to use "Multi: " field name Target.
This option can be selected when in the Feeds Mapping page.

You terms will need to be separated by "|". An example of a valid multi term csv file is below:

"title", "terms"
"This is my 1st Article", "Cat 1|Cat2"
"This is my 2nd Article", "Cat 1|Cat3"
"This is my 3rd Article", "Cat 2"
